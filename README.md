# Weather Application

This is a simple weather application that fetches and displays current weather information for a city using the OpenWeatherMap API. It allows users to enter the name of a city and get the weather details, such as temperature, humidity, weather description, and an emoji representing the weather condition.

## Features

- **City-based Weather Search:** Allows users to input any city name and retrieve weather details.
- **Temperature Display:** Shows the current temperature in Celsius.
- **Humidity Level:** Displays the current humidity of the city.
- **Weather Description:** Provides a brief description of the weather (e.g., clear sky, broken clouds, etc.).
- **Weather Emojis:** Shows an emoji that matches the current weather conditions (e.g., ‚òÄÔ∏è for clear skies, üåßÔ∏è for rain).

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5:** For the webpage structure.
- **CSS3:** For the styling and layout, including background design and responsive layout.
- **JavaScript (ES6):** To fetch weather data from the API and handle the display logic.
- **OpenWeatherMap API:** The API used to fetch real-time weather data based on the user's city input.
